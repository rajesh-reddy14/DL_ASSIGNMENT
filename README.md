Overview
Data augmentation is a technique used to artificially increase the diversity of a dataset by applying various transformations to the existing data. This is particularly useful in machine learning and computer vision tasks where having a diverse and representative dataset is crucial for model generalization and performance.

This repository provides a collection of data augmentation techniques and tools that can be easily integrated into your machine learning pipeline. These augmentations include image.


Supported Augmentations
Image Augmentations
Rotation: Rotate images by a specified angle.
Flip: Flip images horizontally or vertically.
Zoom: Zoom in or out of images.
Brightness and Contrast Adjustment: Adjust the brightness and contrast of images.
Text Augmentations
Random Word Replacement: Replace random words in a text with synonyms or similar words.
Random Insertion: Insert random words into a text.
Random Deletion: Randomly delete words from a text.
Random Swap: Swap the positions of random words in a text.
Tabular Data Augmentations
Random Noise: Add random noise to numerical features.
Missing Values Imputation: Introduce missing values in a controlled manner
